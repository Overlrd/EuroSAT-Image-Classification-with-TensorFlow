# Satellite-Image-Classification-With-Tensorflow
 


In this Notebook i used the EffecientNet V2 model to perform classification on the EuroSAT dataset based on Sentinel-2 satellite images covering 13 spectral bands. It consists of 27,000 labeled samples of 10 different classes: annual and permanent crop, forest, herbaceous vegetation, highway, industrial, pasture, residential, river, and sea lake.
